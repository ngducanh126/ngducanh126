# 👋 Hi, I'm Anh Nguyen

I’m a systems-focused software engineer who thrives at the intersection of cloud infrastructure, data engineering, and machine learning. Whether I’m automating Kubernetes deployments, visualizing GitHub analytics for 5,000+ users, or publishing research on LLM security, I aim to build tools that are technically sound and practically impactful.

I believe great engineering isn’t just about writing code — it’s about solving the right problems with clarity, efficiency, and a sense of purpose.
