# 👋 Hi, I'm Anh Nguyen

I’m a full-stack engineer with a passion for building high-impact, production-ready applications — from blazing-fast frontends to scalable cloud-native backends. I specialize in designing systems that not only work, but drive measurable outcomes: reducing latency, improving user experience, and unlocking data-driven decisions.

Currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at Drexel University, I’ve delivered full-stack systems and dev tools used by 5,000+ users across fintech, medtech, and research. I care deeply about clean code, fast iteration, and building things that matter.
