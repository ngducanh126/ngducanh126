# 👋 Hi, I'm Anh Nguyen

I’m a full-stack engineer who loves building apps that make a real difference — from fast, polished frontends to reliable cloud backends. I focus on systems that don’t just run, but deliver results: faster load times, smoother experiences, and smarter use of data.

I’m earning my B.S. in Computer Science at Drexel University and have built full-stack tools used by 5,000+ users in fintech, medtech, and research. I care about writing clean code, iterating quickly, and creating products that truly matter.
